  It has been exactly 3 years since I wrote my first blog series entitled
  “Flavorful Tuscany”, but starting it was definitely not easy. Back then, I
  didn’t know much about blogging, let alone think that one day it could become
  <strong>my full-time job</strong>. Even though I had many recipes and
  food-related stories to tell, it never crossed my mind that I could be sharing
  them with the whole world.
</p>
<p>
  I am now a <strong>full-time blogger</strong> and the curator of the
  <a

    href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/#"
    >Simply delicious newsletter</a
  >, sharing stories about traveling and cooking, as well as tips on how to run
  a successful blog.
</p>
<p>
  If you are tempted by the idea of creating your own blog, please think about
  the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your story (what do you want to tell your audience)</li>
  <li>Your audience (who do you write for)</li>
  <li>Your blog name and design</li>
</ul>
<p>
  After you get your head around these 3 essentials, all you have to do is grab
  your keyboard and the rest will follow.
